# Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

# Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest
# vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

# A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the
# y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

# Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in
# the area.

# Example 1:
# â€‹
# Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
